The gas fee is **the amount of gas used to do some operation, multiplied by the cost per unit gas**. The fee is paid regardless of whether a transaction succeeds or fails.

The total gas you pay is divided into two components: the `base fee` and the `priority fee` (tip).

**ASK CAN (will the gas fee decrease?):**
