**Ether** (**ETH**): Cryptocurrency of Ethereum. The purpose of ETH is to allow for market computation. This market provides an economic incentive for participants to provide computational power to the network. 

Any participant who broadcasts a transaction request in the network must provide some ETH as payment. The network then awards the bounty to whoever does the work of verifying, executing and committing the transaction to the blockchain, followed by broadcasting it to the network. 

The amount of ETH that is paid by the participant corresponds to the computational resources required to complete the transaction, and is usually denoted as Gas. Gas prevents malicious actors from clogging the network, as there is a monetary cost to it.

Finally, ETH is used to provide crypto-economic security to the network in three ways:
1) It rewards validators who propose blocks or call out dishonest behaviour from other validators
2) It is staked by validators, who put it as collateral to not misbehave (lest it be destroyed)
3) It is used to weigh votes for newly proposed blocks
