A more advanced look at the intricacies of the Ethereum blockchain.

# Bridges

Bridges connect blockchain networks. They enable connectivity and interoperability between blockchains. Blockchains operate in siloed environments, so they cannot trade or communicate with other blockchains naturally.

**Benefits of Bridges:**

Bridges unlock use cases by allowing blockchains to exchange data and move assets between them. Each blockchain has their own advantages and disadvantages, bridges help the development of the overall crypto ecosystem by connecting them together.

For developers, bridges enable:

1) Transfer of data, information and assets across chains.
2) Unlocking new features and use cases for protocols.
3) Opportunity to leverage the strength of different blockchains. For example, developers can benefit from the lower fees offered by different L2 solutions.
4) Collaboration among developers from various blockchain ecosystems.
5) Attracting users and communities from various ecosystems.

**How do they work?**

There are three ways to do cross-chain transfer which stand out:

1) Lock and mint: lock assets on the source chain and mint assets on the destination chain
2) Burn and mint: burn assets on the source chain and mint assets on the destination chain
3) Atomic swaps: swap assets on the source chain for assets on the destination chain with another party

**Bridge Types:**

Bridges can be classified into the following categories:
1) Native bridges: typically built to bootstrap difficulty on a blockchain, making it easier for users to move funds to the ecosystem. 
2) Validator or oracle based bridges: bridges which rely on external validators or oracles to validate cross-chain transfers.
3) Generalized message passing bridges: transfer assets, along with messages and arbitrary data across chains.
4) Liquidity networks: primarily focus on transferring assets from one chain to another with atomic swaps. Generally, they don't support cross-chain message passing.

**Trade-offs to Consider:**

1) Security: who verifies the system? Bridges secured by external validators are less secure than bridges that are locally or natively secured by the blockchain's validators
2) Convenience: how long it takes to complete a transaction, how many transactions did a user need to sign
3) Connectivity: what are the different destinations a bridge can connect to and how difficult is it to integrate a new blockchain
4) Ability to pass more complex data: can a bridge enable the transfer of messages and more complex arbitrary data
5) Cost effectiveness: how much does it cost to transfer assets via a bridge. 

**Trusted Bridges**: bridges which are externally verified. They use an external set of verifiers to send data across chains. As a result, they offer great connectivity. 

**Trustless Bridges**: bridges that rely on the blockchains they are connecting to and their validators to transfer messages and tokens. They are trustless because they do not add new trust assumptions, and as a result are considered more secure.
	**Generalized Message Passing Bridges:** excel with security and transfer more complex data across chains. They are also typically good with cost effectiveness. However, the strengths come at the cost of connectivity for light client bridges and speed drawbacks for optimistic bridges that use fraud proofs.
	**Liquidity Networks:** these bridges use atomic swaps and are logically verified systems. As a result, they excel with security and speed. Moreover, they are cost-effective and offer good connectivity. However, they cannot pass complex data like generalized message passing bridges can.

**Integrating Bridges to dapps:**

1) Building your own bridge is not easy, as it requires years of experience to build a secure and reliable bridge.
2) Many dapps require users to have their native token to interact with them. To enable users to access their tokens, they offer different bridge options on their website. However, this method is a quick fix to the problem as it takes the user away from the dapp interface and still requires them to interact with other dapps and bridges.
3) Integrating a bridge doesnâ€™t require the dapp to send users to the external bridge and DEX interfaces.
4) Integrating multiple bridges solves many problems associated with integrating a single bridge.

# Layer 2

Layer 1 is the base blockchain. Ethereum and Bitcoin are both layer 1, as they are the underlying foundation that layer 2 networks build on top of.

Examples of layer 2 projects include "rollups" on Ethereum and the Lightning Network on Bitcoin. All user transaction activity on the layer 2 projects ultimately settle back to layer 1 of the blockchain.

Ethereum also functions as a data availability layer for layer 2s. Layer 2 projects will post their data on Ethereum (transactions), relying on Ethereum for data availability. This data is used to dispute transactions or get the state of layer 2.

## Layer 2

**Why Layer 2?**

Blockchain is:
1) Decentralized
2) Secure
3) Scalable
A simple blockchain architecture can only achieve two out of the three. The main goal of layer 2 is to achieve scalability without compromising decentralization and security. When the demand to use Ethereum is high (as it only supports 15 transactions per second), the network becomes congested, increasing transaction fees. Layer 2s are solutions which reduce the fees by processing transactions off the blockchain's layer 1.

**Benefits:**

**How does it work?**

Layer 2 is essentially a separate blockchain that extends Ethereum, handling transactions from layer 1 while taking advantage of the security and decentralization. There are a few types of layer 2 blockchains.

**Rollups**

<img src="/researchFiles/Pictures/Untitled 4.avif">

Rollups bundle hundreds of separate transactions into a singular transaction in layer 1. This distributes the L1 transaction fees across everyone in the roll-up, making it cheaper for each user. 

The transaction data is submitted to layer 1, but the execution of the transaction is done by the rollup. By submitting the transaction to layer 1, rollups inherit the security of Ethereum. This is because once the data is uploaded to Ethereum, reverting a rollup requires reverting Ethereum. 

There are two approaches to rollups, which differ primarily on how the transaction data is submitted to layer 1.

1) **Optimistic Rollups:** optimistic in the sense that transactions are assumed to be valid, but can be challenged if necessary. If a transaction is suspected, a fault proof is run to see if it is invalid.
2) **Zero Knowledge Rollups:** zero knowledge rollups use validity proofs, where transactions are computed off-chain and then compressed data is supplied to Ethereum as a proof of validity.

## Scaling

As the number of people who use Ethereum has grown, so has the number of transactions that occur on the chain. The problem with this is that Ethereum can only process 15 transactions per second, meaning that the gas fee for these transactions would be exorbitant due to the high traffic. To combat this, there have been several on-chain and off-chain solutions, increasing the scaling of the blockchain without harming the security and decentralization.

**On-Chain:**

**Sharding**

For a long time, sharding was meant to be the savior in terms of scaling. It is the process of splitting the database, by having subsets of validators responsible for individual shards rather than the entirety of Ethereum. However, the rapid development of rollups and danksharding has led the community to favor roll-up centric scaling.

**Off-Chain:**

**Layer 2 Scaling**

Layer 2 is a collective term for solutions designed to help scale applications by handling transactions off of the mainnet, while also having the full advantage of the security and decentralization of the mainnet.

Most layer 2 solutions are centered around a server or cluster of servers. Generally speaking, transactions are submitted to these layer 2 nodes instead of being submitted directly to layer 1. The layer 2 then batches these transactions up and anchors them to layer 1. 

**Rollups**

*Optimistic Rollups*: scaling Ethereum through moving computation and state storage off-chain. OR's execute transactions outside of Ethereum. Operators bundle multiple off-chain transactions together in large batches to submit to the Ethereum maainnet. This enables spreading fixed costs, and enables aspects like compression to reduce fees for all users.

Optimistic rollups are optimistic because they assume off-chain transactions are valid and don't publish proofs of validity for transactions hosted off-chain. Compared to zero-knowledge rollups, which publish proofs of validity for transactions, optimistic rollups instead rely on a fraud proving scheme to detect cases where transactions are not calculated correctly. After a rollup batch is submitted to Ethereum, there is a timeframe when anyone can challenge the results of the rollup by computing a fraud proof.

If the fraud proof succeeds, the rollup re-executes the transactions and updates the state accordingly. If it does not succeed, or is not challenged, the batch is deemed valid and accepted on Ethereum.

# MEV

MEV refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block reward and gas fees by including, excluding and changing the order of transactions in the block.

**MEV Extraction**

In theory, MEV accrues entirely to validators as they are the only party that can guarantee the execution of a profitable MEV opportunity. In practice, MEV is primarily extracted by independent network participants referred to as searchers. 
	Searchers run complex algorithms on blockchain data to detect profitable MEV opportunities and have bots to automatically submit those profitable transactions to the network.
Validators do get a portion of the full MEV amount as searchers pay a high gas fee to get higher likelihood of their profitable transactions in the block. Assuming searchers are rational, they are willing to pay up to 100% (usually 90%) of their MEV in gas fees.

**Gas Golfing**

This dynamic has made being good at gas golfing profitable. Gas golfing is essentially using tricks to minimize gas usage, such as using accounts with high number of 0's in their hash, or leaving a small amount of tokens in an account as it costs less gas to update a storage slot than to initialize one.

**Generalized Frontrunners**

Rather than programming efficient algorithms to detect MEV opportunities, some searchers run generalized frontrunners. These are bots that watch the mempool to detect profitable transactions. The frontrunner will copy the profitable transaction's code, replace addresses with the frontrunner's address and run the transaction locally to double-check that the modified transaction results in a profit. If it is profitable, the frontrunner will submit the modified transaction with the replaced address and get the original searcher's MEV.

**Flashbots**

It is an independent project which extends execution clients with a service that allows searchers to submit MEV transactions to validators without revealing to the public mempool. This prevents transactions from being frontrun.

## MEV Examples

**Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Arbitrage**:

If two DEXes are offering a token at two different prices, someone can buy it on the lower-priced DEX and sell it on the higher priced DEX in a single atomic transaction. This is true, riskless arbitrage.

**Liquidations:**

Lending protocols like Maker and Aave require users to deposit some collateral. This collateral is then used to lend out to other users.

Users can borrow assets and tokens from others depending on what they need up to a certain percentage of their deposited collateral. 

As the value of the collateral fluctuates, so too does it's borrowing power. If, due to fluctuations, the borrowed amount exceeds the collateral percentage, the protocol allows anyone to liquidate the collateral, paying off lenders. If liquidated the borrower has to pay a liquidation fee, some of which goes to the liquidator.

Searchers compete to parse blockchain data as fast as possible to determine which borrowers can be liquidated and be the first to submit a liquidation transaction and collect the liquidation fee for themselves.

**Sandwich Trading:**

To sandwich, a searcher will watch the mempool for large DEX trades (UNI to DAI trade will increase the price of UNI and decrease the price of DAI). A searcher can calculate the approximate price effects of this large trade, buying the token before the price increases and selling immediately after the large trade.

Sandwiching is however riskier.

**MEV In Ethereum PoS**

There are several issues that MEVs can cause, with an important one being the capability of accelerating blockchain validator centralization. 

A way to fix this that has been proposed is Proposer Builder Separation (PBS). In both PoW and PoS, a node that builds a block proposes it for addition to the chain to other nodes in the consensus. A new block becomes canonical after another miner builds on top of it or it receives enough attestations. 

The combination of block producer and block proposer roles is what causes a majority of the problems that are related to MEV. PBS is designed to mitigate the impact of MEV, especially at the consensus level. With PBS, validators are still responsible for proposing and voting on blocks, but a new class of specialized entities, called block builders, are tasked with ordering transactions and building blocks.

In-protocol proposer-builder separation reduces MEVâ€™s effect on consensus by removing MEV extraction from the purview of validators. Instead, block builders running specialized hardware will capture MEV opportunities going forward.

# Oracles:

Oracles are applications that produce data feeds that make off-chain sources available for smart contracts. This is necessary to access information outside of the blockchain. This makes dapps and smart contracts have a ton more use cases and applications.

Besides pulling off-chain data into smart contracts, oracles can also push data off-chain to external systems. They differ based on source data, system architecture and trust models.

Blockchains are deterministic, as they have to be. Smart contracts execute the same result given information every single time. This means that incorporating non-blockchain data is tough, as this can cause the deterministic aspect to falter. So, oracles are used by smart contracts to gather external information through the use of APIs, and that information is then used for needed transactions.

Because the real-world is not as absolute as the blockchain, there are some issues that arise. For example, how do we verify that the injected information was extracted from the correct source or how do we ensure the data is consistently available and updated regularly?

This results in the **Oracle Problem**:

Oracles are typically validated on the following 3:

1) Correctness: An oracle must guarantee _authenticity_ and _integrity_ of data. Authenticity means the data was gotten from the correct source, while integrity means the data remained intact (i.e. wasnâ€™t altered) before being sent on-chain.
2) Availability: An oracle should not delay or prevent smart contracts from executing actions and triggering state changes. This means that data from an oracle must be _available on request_ without interruption.
3) Incentive Compatibility: An oracle should incentivize off-chain data providers to submit correct information to smart contracts. Incentive compatibility involves _attributability_ and _accountability_. Attributability allows for linking a piece of external information to its provider, while accountability bonds data providers to the information they give, so they can be rewarded or penalized based on the quality of information provided.

**How does an oracle work?**

**Users**: entities that need information external to the blockchain to complete actions. 

Data requests will usually answer some or all of the following questions:

1. What sources can off-chain nodes consult for the requested information?
2. How do reporters process information from data sources and extract useful data points?
3. How many oracle nodes can participate in retrieving the data?
4. How should discrepancies in oracle reports be managed?
5. What method should be implemented in filtering submissions and aggregating reports into a single value?

**Oracle Contract:** the on-chain component for the oracle service. It listens to data requests from other contracts, relays data queries to oracle nodes and broadcasts returned data to client contracts. This contract may also perform some minor computations.

**Oracle Nodes:** the off-chain component for the oracle service. It extracts information from external resources, such as APIs and put's it on-chain for consumption by smart contracts. It essentially acts as a GET request for smart contracts.

## Design Patterns:

**Publish Subscribe**

This type of oracle exposes a data feed which other contracts can regularly read for information. The data is expected to change frequently, so contracts must listen for updates.

**Request Response**

This type allows the client contract to request arbitrary data other than that provided by a publish-subscribe oracle. Ideal when the dataset is too large to be stored in a smart contract's storage.

## Centralized vs. Decentralized:

**Centralized Oracles:**

Controlled by a single entity responsible for aggregating off-chain information and updating the oracle contract's data as requested. Efficient since they rely on a singular source of truth.

**Low Correctness Guarantees**

There is no way to ensure that the data provided is correct or not.

**Poor Availability**

Not guaranteed to always make off-chain data available to other smart contracts.

**Poor Incentive Compatibility**

Often have poorly designed or non-existent incentives for the data provider to send accurate/unaltered information.

**Decentralized Oracles:**

Comprised of multiple participants in a peer-to-peer network that form consensus on off-chain data before sending it to a smart contract.

**High Correctness Guarantee**

- Authenticity proofs: cryptographic mechanisms that validate the source of the information and detect possible alterations to the data after retrieval.
- Consensus based validation of information: rely on multiple oracles to query off-chain information. By comparing multiple oracles, decentralized oracles reduce the risk of passing invalid information to on-chain contracts.
	- Some decentralized oracle networks require participants to vote or stake on the accuracy of answers to data queries using the network's native token. Nodes whose answers deviate are punished by having their tokens taken.
	- Schelling-point mechanisms use game-theory to create single aggregate values, the mean of all entries in the peer-to-peer network in order to minimize on-chain footprint.

**Availability**

Decentralized oracle services ensure high-availability of off-chain data to smart contracts. This is achieved by both decentralizing the off-chain source of information and nodes responsible for transferring information on-chain.

This ensures fault-tolerance. Decentralization at the source and node-operator level is crucial. It is also possible for stake-based oracles to slash node operators who fail to respond quickly to data requests.

**Incentive Compatibility**

Decentralized oracle nodes are often required to sign the data they provide in response to data requests. Decentralized oracles may require nodes to place a stake on their confidence in the truth of data they submit. If the claim checks out, this stake can be returned along with rewards for honest service.

**Applications:**

Retrieving Financial Data: exchange rate data, capital markets data etc. to keep a live feed on prices

Generating Verifiable Randomness: for block-chain based games and lotteries, the deterministic nature of the blockchain is harmful. Therefore, randomness is implemented from external sources.

Getting Outcomes for Events: retrieving real-world event outcomes to enable other novel use cases.

Automating Smart Contracts: smart contracts do not run automatically, thus developers need to trigger some parts of the applications at intervals to ensure it is running smoothly.
