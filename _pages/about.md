Hi! My name is Cem (pronounced Gem). I am a recent engineering graduate from the Industrial Engineering program at the University of Toronto. During undergrad, I pivoted to the information and optimization stream, focusing on algorithm design, operations research, data science and risk analysis. As such, I'm interested in optimization, machine learning, website development and data analysis.

I'm proficient with Python, Java, SQL and R. I've primarily worked with algorithm design and operations research, working with MCMC simulations, developing optimization algorithms, working with game theory and writing linear programs.

This personal website will be where I display my portfolio of projects, keep logs of my ongoing projects and write down any research that I may do. It is linked to both my LinkedIn profile and Github profile, so feel free to check those out!
