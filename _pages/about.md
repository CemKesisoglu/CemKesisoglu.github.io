Hi! My name is Cem (pronounced Gem). I am a recent engineering graduate from the Industrial Engineering programming at the University of Toronto. Throughout my degree I specialized in data science, algorithm design, operations research, continuous improvement and risk assessment.
My professional interests are energy, automation, finance and healthcare, while my personal interests are playing tennis, collecting books and playing video-games!

I am highly proficient with Python (numpy, sklearn, gurobi, pandas, pymc), Java (Spring Boot, OOP) and SQL (SQLite, AccessSQL). I have extensive experience conducting data analysis in Python, SQL, Excel (including VBA automation) and R and with software such as Salesforce, JD Edwards and Tableau. 

I've worked with algorithm design and operations research, and have extensive experience in both deterministic and stochastic optimization methods, including conducting MCMC simulations, developing optimization algorithms, writing linear/integer programs and working with game theory.
