**dapps**: a dapp is an application built on a decentralized network that uses back-end smart contracts and front-end interfaces. On Ethereum, smart contracts are transparent, like open APIs, so your smart contract can include someone else's smart contract.

**==Properties:==**

**Decentralized**: dapps operate on Ethereum, so no-one and no group has control over it. This also means that once you upload a dapp, you cannot take it back
**Deterministic**: dapps perform the same function each time given the parameters
**Turing complete**: dapps can perform any action given required resources
**Isolated**: dapps are executed on the EVM, which is a virtual environment preventing it from having consequential effects on the blockchain

**==Benefits==**:

**Zero downtime**: because they cannot be taken back and are constantly present on the blockchain, they do not have downtime
**Privacy**: you can access dapps anonymously
**Resistance to censorship**: no-one can block individuals from using dapps, submitting transactions or accessing data on the blockchain
**Complete data integrity**: data on the blockchain is immutable and indisputable, which means that malicious actors cannot forge transactions or alter data that has been made public
**Trustless computation and verifiable behavior**: smart contracts can be analyzed and guaranteed to execute in predictable ways, without needing to trust a central authority. 

**==Drawbacks==**:

**Maintenance**: dapps are hard to maintain and update, as code and data published to the blockchain is harder to modify. It's hard for developers to make updates if bugs and security risks are identified in an old version.
**Performance overhead:** scaling is really hard, to achieve the level of security, integrity, transparency and reliability that Ethereum aspires to have, every node runs and stores every transaction.
**Network congestion**: when one dapp uses too many resources, the whole network gets clogged up. Currently, the network can only process 10-15 transactions, so if they are being sent faster than this, the pool of unconfirmed transactions can quickly balloon.
**UX**: user friendly experiences can be tough to achieve
**Centralization**: user and developer friendly solutions build on-top of the Ethereum base layer may end up looking like centralized applications
