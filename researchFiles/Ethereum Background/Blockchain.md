**Blockchain**: is a public database that is updated and shared across multiple computers across one network. 

**Block**: in this public database is the data and the state that's being stored. When transactions are done (for example, you send 1 ETH to someone), a new block has to be added to the blockchain recording that transaction and the state of the system. 

**Chain**: refers to the immutability aspect of these blocks, each block references all of the blocks before it (parents), and thus you cannot change the data within a block without changing all of the preceding ones.
